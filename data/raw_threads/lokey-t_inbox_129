I misspoke the incremental revenues language did get in this draft.  We're trying to get Mary Kay to get together to talk about this around 1:45.  We'll call you.  Maria

SUBJECT: FW: Settlement Offer of Transwestern Pipeline Company
Here are the tariff sheets that we distributed to the parties yesterday.  The language about incremental revenues is not in this draft.  I'm trying to track Steve and Mary Kay down on this issue, but they're in a meeting.  Maria
