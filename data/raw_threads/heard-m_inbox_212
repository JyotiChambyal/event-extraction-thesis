Can you confirm that the listed Liquid Payments Netting Agreements would not apply to power-related receivables held by Enron Power Marketing, Inc.?
Thanks

Attached is a copy of the master netting assignments list that sets forth those that are signed and/or currently being worked on.  As you can see, BP Amoco, Dynegy and Reliant have recently been executed.  A master crude netting agreement has been signed with ConAgra.  Liquid payments netting agreements have been signed with Coastal, Conoco, Morgan Stanley, Sunoco and Valero.  Master Netting Agreements have previously been executed with PG&E, The New Power Company and Entergy-Koch Trading, LP.
Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
