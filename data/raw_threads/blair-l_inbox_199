SUBJECT: Richardson Products Non-payment of Invoices
FYI -
In case you have not yet heard... Richardson Products has not paid their $1,661,000 TW line pack sales invoice.  They are claiming to have a Global Netting Agreement with Enron and are netting this payment with ENA and EGL issues.  We asked for a copy of this agreement even though we are certain that TW is not a party to it.
Paul Cherry, TK, Steve Kleb and I are all following up with our counterparts and are giving the collection of this money top priority.  We will keep you informed.
Rick
