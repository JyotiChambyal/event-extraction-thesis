Gary, would one of the following dates and times work for you and your group?
November 1 - in the afternoon
November 13 - in the morning
November 14 - in the afternoon
Please give me a call and let me know if any of these work.  I am assuming you planning

SUBJECT: Gas Logistics Presentation
Caroline Barnes has indicated that you have a presentation put together that briefly covers the purpose and function of  Gas Logistics, and how this department  interacts with other departments. I was wondering if you would be interested in making the presentation to GMS personnel to better understand how Measurement impacts your department. Please let me know if you have an interest and when you might be available and  I'll arrange for the conference room to be available.
Thanks-
Gary
