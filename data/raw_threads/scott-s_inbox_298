Subject: Medicine Bow Tie-In Capacity

Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:
We received notification that the 5th segment to gate valve 6 providing
a
total firm capacity of 495 Mdth/day was approved by FERC today.  Based
on
the feedback some of you have provided today, and since this is late
notice
on a Friday afternoon, the contracts will be effective on Monday,
October
29, but the capacity will be available tomorrow and Sunday.  We filed
the
6th segment to gate valve 5 this past Tuesday (October 23) and are
prepared
to file the final segment as soon as one currently being reviewed is
approved.
Please call me if you have any questions.
