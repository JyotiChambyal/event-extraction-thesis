SUBJECT: *EMCA* Mosquitoes
I hate to do this, and do not want to put anyone out, but I need some help.
The mosquitoes are terrible.  It is hurting me to look at Kendall (my son) any more, as the number of bites on him have gone into the double digits.
I cannot imagine that we are the only ones suffering from these nasty little pests, and I want to do something about it.
If any of you have time tomorrow, can you do me this - can you call Harris County Mosquito Control and help me complain?  I figure that if a whole load of us start calling, they won't be able to ignore us.
Their number is 713-440-4800.  I get a recording when I call, but their hours are 8 - 5, so maybe we can talk to a live person tomorrow.
Thank you for helping me, and ultimately helping everyone.
Best Regards,
Amy Barnes
