thanks sue!  That actually sounds perfect; I was really looking forward to an evening at home. With the stock well on its way to $10 i don't think there is anything IR can do to rectify the situation, especially not tonight,so I think I should be home by 7. Cooking or Berryhills sounds great. Actually lets cook... as for what, I don't  know. Any ideas?

hey lis....
i'm sorry i was late last night and not in full party mode, i too was in a bit of a mood.  anyway, was going to see if you wanted anything special for dinner tonight.  i thought maybe i could cook something and that we could do presents etc while watching the ever popular felicity.  let me know how your day is looking and if there is anything i can prepare/pick up tonight that strikes your fancy....i'd be happy to grab berry-hill as well if that would hit the spot.
sue
Happy Birthday again!!!
