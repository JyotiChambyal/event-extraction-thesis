Ok, here's the deal.  An engagement retreat is part of the Catholic wedding
sacrament preparation process.  The process general steps are.
1. Meet with priest
2. Take "Focus Tool" test.  Margie said most priests are using this tool
for
marriage preparation.
3. Priest will provide us with a Marriage Encounter registration form and
sponsor us.
Margie said the retreats fill up quickly (the next available is July 19th).
It's a weekend long retreat during which all couples attend talks and then
go away privately to discuss how the issues discussed relate to their
relationship.  She said the talks cover all aspects of life and marriage.

I got your "engagement encounter retreat" message and it sounds
interesting.
