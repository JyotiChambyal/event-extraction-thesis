Subject: ANNGTC MOU

Please find enclosed a revised draft of the ANNGTC MOU reflecting the
discussions held in Houston on Wednesday morning.  Please note in
particular clause 3 which differs slightly from the results of our
discussions.  We are advised that the language that is reflected in that
clause now reflects an approach that is both commercially and
politically necessary to prevent unwanted legislative action in
Washington.  We look forward to discussing this with you on Monday
afternoon at 1:30 P.M. Calgary time.
