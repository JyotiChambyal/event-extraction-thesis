Susan,
Hi!  I apologize for the error, our records are correct but there must have
been a mistake in transcribing onto the FedEx.  I look forward to meeting
you this week.  Could you forward me a copy of your resume in advance of
the
meeting?
Thanks and regards,
Dawn

Dawn,
I wanted to write and let you know that I received the packet of
information
you sent regarding Citadel.  I look forward to meeting with the members of
your team to discuss the expansion opportunities the company is currently
exploring in regards to energy trading.  To correct any confusion in
advance
I also wanted to clarify with you that my last name is Scott, not Smith
(both quite common, generic last names).
Thank you again for the information and affording me the opportunity to
meet
with you next week.
Susan Scott
