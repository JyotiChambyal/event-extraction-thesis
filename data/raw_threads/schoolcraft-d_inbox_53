Gentlemen,
I need to schedule 2 hrs. down time ( zero flow ) for sta. 010169-01 TW / TransColorado I/C ( Blanco Hub receipt ). Starting at 09:00 MST on 3-19-02.
We are going change out a 12" turbine meter out, and visually inspect the meter tube. Rick Downey with Kinder Morgan is scheduling this with his people as well. We should be able to make up the noms. pretty easily, as they always have plenty of line pressure and lots of gas.
Thanks,
Blackie
