Money
<http://www.joygreetings.com/images/100_bill_rotate_md_wht.gif>
It can buy a House
<http://www.joygreetings.com/images/house.jpg>
But not a Home
It can buy a Bed
<http://www.joygreetings.com/images/tired_lg_wht.gif>
But not Sleep
It can buy a Clock
<http://www.joygreetings.com/images/italian_pendulum_clock_swaying_sm_wht.gif>
But not Time
It can buy you a Book
<http://www.joygreetings.com/images/book_page_flip_md_wht.gif>
But not Knowledge
It can buy you a Position
<http://www.joygreetings.com/images/whiteman_cellphone_talking_md_wht.gif>
But not Respect
It can buy you Medicine
<http://www.joygreetings.com/images/bottle_spill_md_wht.gif>
But not Health
It can buy you Blood
<http://www.joygreetings.com/images/bloodbag.jpg>
But not Life
So you see money isn't everything.
And it often causes pain and suffering.
I tell you this because I am your Friend,
and as your Friend I want to
take away your pain and suffering!
<http://www.joygreetings.com/images/100_bill_rotate_md_wht.gif>
So send me all your money and I will suffer for you! Cash only please.
