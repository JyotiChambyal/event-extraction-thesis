The only thing I noticed was in the "Notices" section for administrative matters - we reference Market Services instead of Gas Logistics.

SUBJECT: Interconnect Agreement - Questar Southern Trails
All,
Please review the attached interconnect agreement between Transwestern and Questar.  It is fully reimbursable by Questar.  This interconnect will be a delivery point to Questar in the Blanco Hub.  FYI, the section of pipe that we are connecting the interconnect to is owned by Transwestern and is not part of the jointly owned facilities of the Blanco Hub.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me to discuss.
Please reply back to me with any comments you may have.  I would like to send a draft to Questar on Tuesday morning, January 22, when we return from our holiday.
Bill and Robert - please see the red-lined language addressing the tax reimbursement.
Thanks for your time,
Kim.   X33098
