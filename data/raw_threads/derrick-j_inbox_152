Hi, Jim - - -Paula Rieker seems like a great choice to be Corporate
Secretary. She is a wonderful human being, with a tough inner constitution
and a lot of empathy for others.  So, you two have a lot in common. And, as
I'm sure you know, she is a cancer survivor, of a type another friend of
mine died from. She would also be a great addition to the Vision and Values
Committee, if she's not already on it, as well as any effort to reform and
humanize the PRC.  Congratulations on this great addition to your team. I
just wish that we had more people with values like the two of you and Rob
better dispersed throughout the leadership of some of our  commercial
groups! - - -DLH
