Spoke with Richard Jordan at SWG this afternoon re: Phoenix ROW and El Paso F/R contracts.
Richard said if the FERC staff recommendation for F/R is accepted, it will leave SWG in the position of needing a "substantial" amount of new transport capacity.
As for Phoenix ROW, they are looking at possibly taking the 8-inch line out of service and conveying it to us for Sun Devil in exchange for transport capacity on the project.  Their ROW varies in  type and width plus some is single use.  If they traded the line segment to us, we could use the existing ROW and just replace the line.
Anyway, I said we would stay in touch with them as things progressed with SD, hoping that things move a little faster now that FERC has given the market some direction.
