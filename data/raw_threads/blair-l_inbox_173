Is there any way to indicate the amount they exceeded 1,900 on an hourly basis for the days indicated "YES"?

Jodie,
The attached file contains the LS Power Whitewater's hourly rate from 12/20/01 to 6/17/01.  If you need data prior to 6/17/01 we will have retrieve it from microfiche.  The file has a column for the scan hour, hourly rate, and a YES if the hour exceeded 1900.0 mcf per hour.  If you have any questions call me at x31534
