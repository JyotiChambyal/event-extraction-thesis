Sounds okay to me.  If y'all could just check the
times of the movies and let me know when to be there,
I will appear with bells on.  Jeans okay or should I
wear slacks to eat a burger?    Me

Actually, we don't know what we're going to do.  We
were talking about this
last night and since our house is still torn up and
we haven't ordered a
dinner yet maybe the best thing is just go somewhere
to eat.  I said maybe
we could go to an early movie and then go eat
someplace.  Even ribs at
Luthers or a Whataburger would be good .  What do
you think?
I would love a few oysters.

p.s.  Yes, I think all the Marie's have closed!

Hi!  What are y'all doing Thursday?  Do y'all just
want to meet someplace or what?  If so, where?
Also, did the Marie Calendar's by you all close?
Rossana was saying that the ones she used to go to
have all closed.
Also, would you like some raw oysters from Nelson's?
I know Marie doesn't, but I know you like 'em and I
won't be eating all of them.  Lou said that we'd be
getting some more at Christmas.      Me
