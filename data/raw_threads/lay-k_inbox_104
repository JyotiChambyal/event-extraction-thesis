Ken--
Following up on my previous email, would you ask your assistant to revert
to me by email with the name and contact information for the person that
you think it would be best for us to contact regarding your e-Learning
initiatives internally at Enron?  Thanks.
Regards,
Greg

Subject:     Follow up from our meeting
Ken--
I just wanted to thank you again for inviting me to Houston, and more
importantly, for the support you and Enron are providing to Technology for
All and the joint TFA/SmartForce project.  I believe that we are going to
help make a real difference.
I also wanted to follow up our brief conversation, where we discussed
getting some of our people together with your people at Enron (I believe
that you indicated that your head of HR would be a good start) to see
whether there are ways in which SmartForce can help Enron achieve some of
its business objectives around learning and training.
I would appreciate it if you would have someone email to me the contact
information for whomever it would be appropriate for us to approach.  I'll
take care of the rest from my end.  Thanks again.
Regards,
Greg
